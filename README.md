# Remote Control Desktop Mac

## About

A web app that allows you to control your Mac computer (mouse and keyboard) directly from your phone!

## How it works

The app uses sockets to establish a real time connection from your phone/client to the server running on your computer. Dragging one finger accross the screen moves the mouse, and using two lets you scroll (just like a touchpad). Toggle the keyboard button at the top of the app to type on your computer.

## Installation & Set Up

1. git clone this repo or download the zipped folder and unpack
2. open terminal at the root directory of the project and run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   to install all the packages necessary to run the project
3. to start the app, run:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   A url will show on console; put this url into your mobile browser and you can now control your PC from your phone.

4. to stop the server and web app, simply hit `Ctrl+C` in the console that is
   running the program.

NOTE: Your phone MUST be connected to the same wifi network as your computer

NOTE: Additional [installation requirements](https://github.com/kapetan/osx-mouse#limitations)
for later versions of MacOS may be required.

WARNING: Keep these urls private, as anyone else on the same wifi network can use them to control your computer while the server is running!!!
